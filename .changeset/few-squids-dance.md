Add a workspace runner to Wiggum CLI with independent project graph calculation, including project listing/graph commands, graph-based execution ordering, filtering, concurrency controls, and dry-run JSON planning output. Runner failure flows now include richer AI remediation context (`--autofix`) and optional prompt generation (`--ai-prompt`) for failed project runs, with prompt fallback support in non-interactive environments. Runner flag parsing now rejects empty `--project` filters and invalid `WIGGUM_RUNNER_PARALLEL` / concurrency values with clear errors, while supporting `--project` and `-p` (including `-p=<pattern>`) aliases and allowing `run`/`projects` options before command tokens. Agent chat mode now clearly guards against non-interactive terminals, agent serve flags support long/equal/short forms (`--flag value`, `--flag=value`, `-p/-H`, `-p=<port>`, `-H=<host>`) plus a `--host` alias with strict validation, and passthrough flag forwarding is documented for overlapping global/tool flags.
