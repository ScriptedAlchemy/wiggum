Add a workspace runner to Wiggum CLI with independent project graph calculation, including project listing/graph commands, graph-based execution ordering, filtering, concurrency controls, and dry-run JSON planning output. Runner failure flows now include richer AI remediation context (`--autofix`) and optional prompt generation (`--ai-prompt`) for failed project runs.
